An Analysis of Adult Income Level

The dataset was provided by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data consists from people with 14 attributes including education, workclass, occupation, sex, native-country, etc. and then lists their yearly income as >50k or <=50k. This data was donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository in 1996. The purpose of this data set is to "Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data." The data was extracted from a 1994 Census database.

## Instructions

Go analysis > SebiUnipan > Download 'Course Project Solo 122.twb' and open it with Tableau.
Milestones 1-3 were assignments where I had to fetch a dataset, and get it approved. I then had to start formulating research questions around the dataset. Lastly I created many graphs to visualize the data in meaningful ways through python based pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. These Milestone files can be opened with Jupyter Lab.
